notes: "Ensure we probe the right domain: if filenames are observation IDs, do not join to photos.photo_id."

## Summary
Determine duplicates by (a) matching id_core against the correct domain (observation vs photo) and (b) sha256/pHash collisions versus iNat primaries; write reasons.

## Acceptance
- CSV with `{filename, dup_reason âˆˆ {obs_id, photo_id, sha256, phash}, matched_key}`
- Summary stats consistent with prior sampling
