## Summary

Synthesize investigation findings to provide clear recommendation:
- Compile duplicate percentage and absolute counts
- Assess taxonomic value of unique data
- Consider implementation effort vs. benefit
- Provide go/no-go recommendation with supporting rationale
- If proceeding, outline integration approach

## Tasks
- [ ] Compile all statistics from investigation phases
- [ ] Calculate cost-benefit analysis (effort vs. unique data value)
- [ ] Consider edge cases and implementation challenges
- [ ] Document recommendation with supporting evidence
- [ ] If positive recommendation, outline integration plan
- [ ] Address null field handling (observer_id, latitude, etc.)
- [ ] Specify origin value for new data

## Notes

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH INTEGRATION** ✅

**Summary Decision Matrix Score: 8.25/10**

Key findings:
1. ✅ Duplicate rate: 51% (well below 90% threshold)
2. ✅ Taxonomic value: HIGH (1,139 species, many rare taxa)  
3. ✅ Expert labels: Higher quality than citizen science
4. ⚠️ Implementation: MODERATE complexity (manageable)

**Estimated Value**: ~27,000 new expert-labeled bee observations
**ROI**: Very High - substantial scientific value for minimal effort

**Implementation approach outlined in main recommendation document.**
