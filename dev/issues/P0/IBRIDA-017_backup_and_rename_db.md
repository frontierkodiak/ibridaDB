## Summary
Create a custom-format dump (`.dump`) of `ibrida-v0-r1`, verify checksum + pg_restore listing, attempt a scratch restore, then **rename** DB to `ibrida-v0`. Update in-repo references everywhere **except** archival wrappers (`dbTools/ingest/export v0/r0,r1`).  

## Tasks
- [ ] Run `dbTools/admin/backup_ibrida_v0r1.sh` to produce `/datasets/ibrida-data/backups/â€¦/ibrida-v0-r1.dump`
- [ ] Optional: restore into `ibrida-v0-r1_scratch` to validate
- [ ] Terminate sessions & `ALTER DATABASE "ibrida-v0-r1" RENAME TO "ibrida-v0"`
- [ ] Update references (CLAUDE.md, scripts) excluding archival wrappers; commit on branch
- [ ] Sanity psql checks on `ibrida-v0`

## Acceptance
- Verified dump and successful scratch restore
- DB now visible as `ibrida-v0`
- Reference updates committed on branch (diff isolates archival dirs)

## Context
- Admin helpers added in prior ops step; CLAUDE.md & tree show current DB naming.
