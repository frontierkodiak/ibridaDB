## Summary

For non-duplicate anthophila images, assess taxonomic value:
- Extract taxonomic information from directory names
- Compare taxonomic coverage against existing observations
- Identify rare taxa or underrepresented species
- Assess expert-label quality value proposition
- Calculate sample counts per taxon

## Tasks
- [ ] Parse directory names to extract taxonomic information (genus_species format)
- [ ] Use typus to get taxon_id from scientific names
- [ ] Query existing observations for taxonomic coverage comparison
- [ ] Identify taxa that are rare/underrepresented in current dataset
- [ ] Count samples per taxon for non-duplicate data
- [ ] Assess quality/value of expert labels vs. citizen science labels

## Notes

**COMPLETED ANALYSIS:**

**Taxonomic Coverage:**
- 1,139 unique species in anthophila dataset
- Many rare species with low database representation (e.g., Megachile addenda: 17 existing obs, Megachile canescens: 37 existing obs)
- Specialized bee genera (Osmia, Megachile, rare Andrena) well represented
- Expert taxonomist labels = higher quality than citizen science

**Value Assessment:**
- Rare species could significantly increase database coverage
- Expert labels valuable for training/validation
- ~27,000 estimated new observations worth integrating
- Clear taxonomic value justifies integration effort

**Result: HIGH VALUE - Proceed with integration**
