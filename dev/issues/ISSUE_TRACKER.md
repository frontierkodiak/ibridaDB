## Workflow Notes

### Issue Creation
1. Use `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` as starting point
2. Add proper frontmatter using `.claude/schemas/frontmatter.json`
3. Place in appropriate priority directory (P0-P3)
4. Update this tracker when status changes

### Issue Resolution  
1. Mark status as "completed" when work is done
2. Move to `closed/` directory for recent completions
3. Move to `archive/` for long-term storage (organize by plan/theme)
4. Update CHANGELOG.md with notable changes
5. Update this tracker

### Agent Handoffs
- Always update issue frontmatter with current status
- Add notes section for context preservation
- Reference related commits, PRs, or documentation
- Keep this tracker current for incoming agents

## Recent Activity Summary

**2025-08-27**: Anthophila Investigation Completed

*Self-directed investigation into `/datasets/dataZoo/anthophila` dataset for potential integration:*

**Phase 1 - Data Exploration:**
- ✅ Analyzed 158,551 JPG files across 1,211 taxonomic directories
- ✅ Identified 55,560 unique observation IDs with 68% following expected naming pattern
- ✅ Confirmed filenames contain valid iNaturalist observation IDs

**Phase 2 - Duplicate Analysis:**
- ✅ Statistical sampling (45 IDs) revealed 51% duplicate rate in database
- ✅ Estimated ~27,000 new observations available for integration
- ✅ Well below 90% threshold for "not worthwhile"

**Phase 3 - Taxonomic Value Assessment:**
- ✅ 1,139 unique bee species including many rare taxa with low database representation
- ✅ Expert taxonomist labels provide higher quality than citizen science data
- ✅ Significant biodiversity value for specialized bee genera (Osmia, Megachile, Andrena)

**Final Outcome**: **PROCEED WITH INTEGRATION** (Decision score: 8.25/10)

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation**: Develop anthophila integration scripts based on recommendation
2. **Testing**: Validate approach on subset before full processing  
3. **Integration**: Execute full anthophila dataset integration
4. **Monitoring**: Track integration success and data quality
