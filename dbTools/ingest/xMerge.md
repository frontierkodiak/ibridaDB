# xMerge

```
How can we change our code and/or our execution environment to efficiently batch and parallel process on our operation, particularly the GEOM calculation (but also primary key constraint setting, at least applying to the 3 in parallel, if possible)? 

I'd be happy to speed this batch of SQL code up by optimizing it fairly thoroughly, especially if we can turn it into a reusable/templated script that takes certain script variables as arguments/parameters. 

**
We're using a server with 128GB RAM and a AMD 5900x processor, so we should have capacity for parallelization. Neither the PSQL database nor the CSVs we import are on SSDs, but they are both on a reasonably high-performance raidz2 6-HDD array (4x read acceleration, with negligible write speed boost) with ample SSD cache. The index operation was definitely CPU-pegged, but it seems like the GEOM calculation isn't pinning any single core to 100%. 


Given all this context, please adapt our merge script's strategy and implementation to optimize for execution time via parallelization, and possible other optimizations as you see fit. I'd prefer an elegant, relatively simple, well-commented implementation.

```bash
chmod +x ~/repo/ibridaDB/dbTools/ingest/xMerge.sh
```

```bash
# Ensure the container is running
docker start ibrida

# Execute the SQL script
docker exec -ti ibrida psql -U postgres -f /queries/ingest/xMerge.sql

# Execute the Bash script for parallel updates
docker exec -ti ibrida /bin/bash -c "/tools/ingest/xMerge.sh"
```
